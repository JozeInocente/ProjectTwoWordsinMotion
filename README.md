# Project overview
### For me the concept of community is related to people working together to reach a common goal. That goal is what brings them together, and what drives them to stay connected. In the context of "Outer Wilds" the rich theme of exploration, curiosity, and interconnectedness is what essentially creates that sense of community within the game. There are quotes that reflect the importance of shared knowledge, collaboration, and the sense of belonging that ties the characters and the universe together. The quotes I picked reflect on connections between individuals working together but knowledge passed down through time, it is as much about individual discovery as it is about the collective contributions of many.
# Technical overview
### The animation is kept very simple, with the use of CSS in Visual Studio Code, I created a page that slowly presents these quotes to the viewer, and highlighting certain words with links attached the user can then discover the next quote. I believe this interaction helps convey that feeling of exploration and finding meaning behind the word that was higlighted.
# Acknoledgement
### A lot of the code used was found and borrowed from https://stackoverflow.com/ posts.
